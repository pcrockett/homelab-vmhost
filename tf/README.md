# terraform config

tf documentation is truncated on the official terraform provider documentation site. for
full documentation, you need to visit github directly, for example:

<https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/blob/v0.9.1/docs/resources/domain.md>

be aware that the example code blocks you see might not match up exactly with the schema
descriptions.
